# InfiniteZero Foundation Open Source Website

Welcome to the **InfiniteZero Foundation** project! This repository hosts the official website for **InfiniteZero Foundation**, an innovative peer-to-peer decentralized infrastructure for AI and data marketplaces. This website provides detailed information on how the protocol works, its features, and the roadmap for its development.

> **Note:** DIN will remain as the academic reference for our early papers, but **InfiniteZero Foundation** is now the home for the network and ecosystem going forward.

This keeps everything in Markdown format, updates all references from DIN to **InfiniteZero Foundation**, and includes a note about DIN as the academic reference.  

If you want, I can also **update the “About InfiniteZero Foundation” section** with a slightly more polished, brand-forward description for the README. Do you want me to do that?
