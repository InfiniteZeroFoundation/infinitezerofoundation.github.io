- **Build on InfiniteZero**: Create open-source or proprietary AI models that run securely on user devices.
- **Earn Revenue**: Your application earns revenue every time AI models are trained via network fees. When your app enables model training, you receive a share of those fees.
- **Collaborate Globally**: Join a growing community of developers to enhance and expand AI capabilities.
