# Research at InfiniteZero

At InfiniteZero, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of AI research to build a **trustless**, **privacy-preserving**, and **community-governed** AI infrastructure. Our research efforts are focused on creating ethical, scalable, and innovative solutions that empower individuals and communities, making AI more accessible, sustainable, and secure for everyone.

## Key Areas of Research

### 1. **Privacy-Preserving AI**  
At the core of our mission is the development of AI that respects user privacy. We are exploring new methods for **on-device learning** and **encrypted pattern sharing** that allow AI models to improve without compromising user data. This ensures that the future of AI doesn’t come at the cost of personal privacy.

### 2. **Decentralized AI Infrastructure**  
We are leading the way in building AI systems that are **community-owned** and **decentralized**. Our research into blockchain and Layer 2 networks allows us to create systems where no central authority controls the AI models. This helps ensure transparency, fairness, and resilience in AI-driven economies.

### 3. **Scalability and Efficiency**  
To make AI accessible to all, we are researching lightweight AI models and methods that enable **edge computing**. By optimizing AI to run on **local devices** (e.g., smartphones, laptops, even Raspberry Pi), we can drastically reduce the need for expensive hardware and centralized infrastructure, making AI more efficient and affordable for everyone.

### 4. **Open-Source AI Commons**  
As part of our commitment to inclusivity, we are researching frameworks for open-source AI that benefits the global community. Our goal is to create a public, accessible repository of AI models, data, and tools that anyone can contribute to and use, helping accelerate innovation while ensuring AI models remain **open** and **transparent**.
