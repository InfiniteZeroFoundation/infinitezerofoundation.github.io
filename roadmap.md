# InfiniteZero Roadmap

At InfiniteZero, we're committed to delivering on our vision of a **trustless**, **privacy-preserving** AI infrastructure that is owned and governed by the community. Our roadmap outlines the key milestones as we continue to build, test, and launch the InfiniteZero network. 

We're just getting started, and we have exciting plans ahead as we approach each phase of development.

---

## Roadmap Overview

### **Devnet - March 2026**
Our journey begins with the **Devnet** phase, where we’ll begin testing the core infrastructure of the InfiniteZero network. This will be a closed network for developers and early contributors to experiment with, helping us refine the technology before going public.

- **Goals**: 
  - Launch Devnet for internal testing
  - Validate core features and functionality
  - Optimize performance and scalability

### **Testnet - Mid 2026**
Once the Devnet phase has concluded, we’ll launch **Testnet**. During this phase, we’ll invite the wider community, including developers and users, to help us test the network in real-world conditions. The focus will be on **security**, **scalability**, and ensuring that the **privacy-preserving** features work as intended.

- **Goals**: 
  - Open up the network to external testing
  - Collect valuable feedback and data
  - Ensure stability and security for all participants

### **Advanced Testnet - Late 2026**
Following the initial round of testing, the **Advanced Testnet** phase will bring enhancements to network performance and additional features. During this phase, we’ll continue fine-tuning the infrastructure and adding more advanced functionalities, paving the way for the final product.

- **Goals**:
  - Implement advanced features and optimizations
  - Test the integration of key technologies (e.g., Layer 2, blockchain interoperability)
  - Prepare for scaling to a global user base

### **Mainnet Launch - Mid 2027**
The launch of the **Mainnet** will mark the official, public deployment of the InfiniteZero network. This is where the network will be fully operational, open to all developers, applications, and users. The **Mainnet** launch will bring the InfiniteZero vision to life with a privacy-first, decentralized infrastructure that anyone can use.

- **Goals**:
  - Officially launch the InfiniteZero Mainnet
  - Enable decentralized AI model training and applications
  - Open up the ecosystem for public use and adoption

## Looking Ahead

The road to building a **trustless**, **privacy-preserving** AI ecosystem is long and filled with exciting challenges. We are focused on creating a **secure**, **scalable**, and **inclusive** platform that works for **everyone**—developers, users, and the community.

Stay tuned for updates and get involved at each stage as we move closer to the full launch of InfiniteZero!
